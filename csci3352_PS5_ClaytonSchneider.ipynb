    "This assignment is due on Canvas by **11:55pm on Friday, February 19th**. Your solutions to non-programming questions should be done in Markdown directly below the associated question. Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own** (see syllabus for detailed guidance). There are 102 points total, and 37 pts extra credit.\n",

    "- Unless a url is given for a data set, you will find the required data on the course Canvas.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly in Markdown, you may do your work on paper first and then typeset it later. This [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) provides helpful guidance for writing math in Markdown. \n",
    "- It is **unhelpful** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code.\n",

    "## Problem 2 : Where did all the links go? (92 pts total)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will implement and systematically evaluate the `baseline`, `Jaccard coefficient` and `degree product` predictors for missing links. As with the missing attribute prediction in PS4, we'll build up this numerical experiment in stages.\n",
    "* First, you'll implement the `baseline`, `Jaccard coefficient`, and `degree product` score functions.\n",
    "* Then, you'll construct an ROC curve and compute its AUC using synthetic data.\n",
    "* After that, you'll construct a *good* test of the 3 link predictors for a single level of _missingness_ $\\alpha$. \n",
    "* And finally, you'll write a wrapper around this function to explore how performance varies as a function of $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last two steps, we'll again use a real-world network derived from the genes of the human malaria parasite _P. falciparum_. These genes are located in one of nine highly variable regions (HVRs) in the DBLa domain of the parasite's var protein. In this network, nodes are antigen *genes* of the parasite and two nodes are connected if they contain evidence of past non-homologous *recombination* (basically, if they share a long subsequence).\n",
    "* Visit the [Index of Complex Networks](https://icon.colorado.edu/) and obtain the `HVR_1` network via the ICON entry _Malaria var DBLa HVR networks_."

    "### Problem 2-A (12 pts) : baseline, Jaccard, and degree product score functions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write 3 seperate functions to implement the `predictor_Baseline()`, `predictor_Jaccard()`, and `predictor_DegreeProd()` score functions, as described in Lecture Notes 4. Function interfaces are given below.\n",
    "* Then write a function `apply_Predictors(G,Y)`, which applies the three predictors to a given simple network `G` with list of missing links `Y`. This function should\n",
    "  * first obtain the list of candidate pairs (non-edges in `G`, defined as `X` in the Lecture Notes),\n",
    "  * for each such pair, apply the 3 predictors, and\n",
    "  * store the results in a way that allows you to output a table of the form shown in Lecture Notes 4, with columns `i,j,tau,score_baseline,score_Jaccard,score_DegreePred`\n",
    "* Then,\n",
    "  * run your function on the $G_\\circ$ given below\n",
    "  * sort the rows of the output table by the `score_Jaccard` column, and \n",
    "  * write out the sorted table in the form `{i},{j} : {tau} : {baseline}  {jaccard}  {degree prod}`\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 1: `networkx` has two built-in functions that may be useful: `jaccard_coefficient()` and `preferential_attachment()`, but note that you will need to write a wrapper around each in order to make them break ties randomly the way we defined in the lecture notes. Also, be warned: these functions return a 'generator'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 2a: I found it useful to have `apply_Predictors(G,Y)` return its results as a 2d numpy array, where the first 2 columns are $i,j$, the 3rd column is the $\\tau$ value indicating if $i,j$ is a missing edge or not, and the last 3 columns give the baseline, jaccard, and degree product scores in that order. This made it straightforward to then sort the rows by the jaccard score, using the `.argsort()` function. You're free to use whatever data structure you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 2b: I also found it useful to implement a helper function `get_candidateEdges(G)` that took as input `G` and returned as output `X`, the list of non-edges in `G`, which my `apply_Predictors(G,Y)` function calls."

It was then straightforward to plot each of columns 2,3,4 vs. column 1 to make the target plot. As in PS4, I also found it useful to separate the code for the experiment from the code for the visualization, so that I could tinker with the latter without having to re-run the former.
